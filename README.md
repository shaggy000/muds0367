What was the purpose of setting up the FSSAI?
In a nutshell, the FSSAI agency was established to improve the productivity and ease of food safety registration and regulation in India. As time progressed, it became evident that there was a strong need for the establishment of a body to govern food safety supervision across India. The reason for this was that the entire system of food safety monitoring and regulation in the country was exceedingly unstable. Because the job was delegated to different agencies around the country, managing food safety rules in the country became extremely complex. In order to clean up the mess and make the process more efficient, a new organizational entity named the FSSAI was formed and entrusted with all of the functions listed above. In other words, the FSSAI was designated as the sole agency in the country with the authority to monitor food safety and quality standards throughout the country. To operate in the market today, all food manufacturers must get an FSSAI Registration.
